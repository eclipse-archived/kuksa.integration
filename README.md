# Kuksa-Integration Repo

This Repository contains necessary tests for Eclipse Kuksa Platforms.

Currently, Eclipse HONO API (including MQTT) and Hawkbit API tests are implemented.
Appstore tests will follow as well as a Jenkins CI config file.

# Getting Started with Eclipse Kuksa

## What can you do with Eclipse Kuksa?

* Build and deploy in-vehicle applications based on AGL (see more info [here](https://agl-kuksa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
* Add services to Kuksa-AGL (see more info [here](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.invehicle/tree/master/agl-kuksa)) to build custom AGL-based in-vehicle HMI systems
* Setup a cloud cluster consisting of Eclipse Hono, Eclipse HawkBit, the Kuksa Appstore, and more to provide a connected vehicle ecosystem (see more info [here](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.cloud))
* Setup an Eclipse Che based APPSTACLE IDE to either develop, build, and deploy cloud or in-vehicle applications (see more info [here](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.ide))
* Use different applications for various connected vehicle needs such as
  * [Direct Access API](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.invehicle/tree/master/direct-access-api)
